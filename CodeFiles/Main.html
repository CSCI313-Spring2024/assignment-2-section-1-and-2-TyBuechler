          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Ty Buechler, and I am a Junior at North Dakota State University (NDSU), majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering and minoring in Artificial Intelligence. 
            I have a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and software development, and I’m particularly interested in areas like machine learning, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of academics, I serve as the Vice President of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) at NDSU. In this role, I help oversee chapter operations, recruitment, and event planning, while also fostering leadership and brotherhood within our fraternity. 
            Being in a leadership position has helped me develop my skills in team management, organization, and strategic planning.
            <br>
            <br>
            Professionally, I work in the IT Department at MasTec, a company based in Coral Gables, Florida. 
            My role involves troubleshooting technical issues, assisting with system management, and gaining hands-on experience with networking, cybersecurity, and enterprise IT systems. 
            This experience has given me valuable insight into the tech industry and how large organizations operate.
            <br>
            <br>
            I grew up in Salisbury, North Carolina, where I lived for 15 years before moving to Brunswick, Georgia. 
            From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by technology and how things work, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in software engineering.

        <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
        Hi, my name is Ty Buechler! I'm a Junior at North Dakota State University, majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering and minoring in Artificial Intelligence. 
        My passion for technology and video games inspired me to pursue this field, as I love the idea of building innovative software that can improve lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        My career interests are broad, ranging from cybersecurity to software development for major companies. 
        Lately, I’ve been intrigued by the idea of enhancing sporting events with technology—things like ball-tracking systems for the NFL or other tools that could improve the fan and player experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I work in the IT Department at MasTec, where I developed a form system to track company assets and store device information, making it easier to handle repairs and maintenance. 
        At NDSU, I’ve worked on projects like a dog adoption website for my CSCI 213 class and have even started building a website for my mom—though that one’s still on the back burner! My strongest programming language is Java, but I’m eager to expand my skills in Python and C#.
        <br>
        <br>
        Outside of tech, I’m a huge Carolina Panthers fan and used to create YouTube videos doing Madden and College Football 25 rebuilds. 
        I also love playing the drums, though having roommates has put a pause on that for now. Additionally, I’m the Vice President of Tau Kappa Epsilon, where I help organize service events, ensuring each member completes at least 10 service hours per semester.
